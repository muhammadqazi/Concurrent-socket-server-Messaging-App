### Computer Network Design and Applications



#### Recommendations & Rules:

-  The applications must be written in C/C++ in Linux Platform.
-  Server application should operate in concurrent mode. (So application serve more
than one user at a time)
-  Only listed library can be used for file parsing. Using other libraries or classes
prohibited. Write your own functions if it’s necessary.
- Unless otherwise explicitly specified, all written assignments or code that is submitted
is to be entirely the student’s own work. Using any code or copying any assignment
from others is strictly prohibited without advance prior permission from the instructor.
-  All students’ work is their own. Students who do share their work with others are as
responsible for academic dishonesty as the student receiving the material.
-  Students who encourage others to cheat or plagiarize, or students who are aware of plagiarism or cheating and do not report it are also participating in academically
dishonest behavior.
-  In this case (academically dishonest behavior), students to be punished with no grade.
